config COMPILER_WORKAROUND_CACHE_ATTR
	bool
	default n
	depends on XTENSA
	help
	  Select this to activate use of functions instead of macros
	  to decide whether an address is cacheable or not.
	  There is a weird optimization bug with gcc10x and gcc8.1
	  (with -O2 flags) on IMX platforms. See PR #4605.

        default n
        help
          When enabled, -fno-inline-function option is not passed to compiler

config COLD_STORE_EXECUTE_DRAM
        bool "Execute and use cold data and code in DRAM"
        help
	  Non-performance critical data and code can be kept in DRAM to be
	  accessed and executed there without copying to SRAM. Select this
	  option to enable this feature to save SRAM and to speed up SRAM
	  copying of performance-critical data and code.


config COLD_STORE_EXECUTE_DEBUG
	bool "Enable checks for cold code on hot paths"
	help
	  This enables an assert_can_be_cold() check, which causes an exception
	  if called in the LL task context and assert() evaluation is enabled.

config FAST_GET
	bool "Enable simple refcounting DRAM data copier"
	default n
	help
	  Enable simple refcounting DRAM data copier for copying processing
	  module data from DRAM to SRAM when the data is needed and freeing
	  the SRAM when the data is not needed anymore. If multiple module
	  instances need the same chunk the same copy is used with reference
	  counting. Source is src/lib/fast-get.c. The option should be selected
	  on platforms, where __cold_rodata is supported.

config DEBUG_MEMORY_USAGE_SCAN
	bool "Memory usage scan"
	default y
	help
	  It enables memory usage scan at demand in runtime.
	  This feature does not affect standard memory operations,
	  especially allocation and deallocation.

config DEBUG_LOCKS
	bool "Spinlock debug"
	default n
	help
	  It adds additional information to the spinlocks about
	  the current user of the lock. Also executes panic
	  on deadlock.

config DEBUG_LOCKS_VERBOSE
	bool "Spinlock verbose debug"
	depends on DEBUG_LOCKS
	default n
	help
	  In addition to DEBUG_LOCKS it also adds spinlock traces
	  every time the lock is acquired.

config DEBUG_IPC_TIMINGS
	bool "Enable IPC message handling time logging"
	depends on DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Adds a logging after IPC handling before putting IPC reply
	  to send queue. The logging contains both the reply and the
	  original request message headers and the time that it took
	  to process the request in micro seconds. The value can be
	  used to collect statistics on changes in firmware response
	  times. This also disables the logging of the received
	  request on core 0 to avoid flooding the logs too much.

config SCHEDULE_LOG_CYCLE_STATISTICS
	bool "Log cycles per tick statistics for each task separately"
	default y
	help
	  Log DSP cycle usage statistics about once per second (1ms *
	  1024) for each task separately. The printed data is task's
	  meta information, average number of cycles/tick, and maximum
	  number of cycles/tick during the previous 1024 tick period.

config PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS
	bool "Performance counters"
	default n
	help
	  Enables tracing of simple performance measurements.
	  A basic use case is to measure number of platform & cpu clock ticks
	  passed between two checkpoints (init() and stamp()), for example
	  total time spent on running low latency scheduler tasks.
	  Platforms that gate cpu clock in wait-for-interrupt calls may also
	  use the stamp() macro periodically to find out how long the cpu
	  was in active/sleep state between the calls and estimate the cpu load.

config PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS_COMPONENT
	bool "Use performance counters to track component execution"
	default n
	depends on PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS
	help
	  Use performance counters to trace low-latency task execution.
	  This enables to observe average and peak execution times at
	  audio component level granularity.
	  Results are reported via logging subsystem.

config PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS_LL_TASKS
	bool "Use performance counters to track LL task execution"
	default n
	depends on PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS
	help
	  Use performance counters to trace low-latency task execution.
	  This enables to observe average and peak execution times at
	  task level granularity.
	  Results are reported via logging subsystem.

config DSP_RESIDENCY_COUNTERS
	bool "DSP residency counters"
	default n
	help
	  Enables simple DSP residency counters in SRAM_REG mailbox.
	  R0, R1, R2 are abstract states which can be used differently
	  based on platform implementation.
