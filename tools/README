Sound Open Firmware Tools
=========================

This is a collection of open source tools used to develop open source audio
DSP firmwares for ALSA.

sof-logger
======

sof-logger is used to print logs delivered from FW dma_trace mechanism, by searching log
entries in *.ldc file generated by rimage. 

Every entry declared in FW is placed in elf output file (e.g. sof-apl) in 
.static_log_entries section in a form of struct defined in sof/src/include/sof/trace.h
in sof fw repo.

*.ldc file contains snd_sof_logs_header (defined in rmbox/logger_convert.c) 
following by .static_log_entries section incorporated from FW elf file (e.g. sof-apl).
snd_sof_logs_header contains basic information about .static_log_entries section
like base_address and data_length.

sof-logger works by reading entry parameters value and entries addresses from FW
dma_trace mechanism and searching suitable entry in *.ldc file by its address.

Usage sof-logger <option(s)> <file(s)>
			Display mailbox contents
-h			help
-l *.ldc_file		Specify the *.ldc file
-i in_file		Get traces from in_file, instead of the default 
			"/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-o out_file		Specify the output file, instead of default stdout
-t			Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace", instead 
			of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-p			Get traces from stdin, instead of the default 
			"/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-c			Set timestamp clock in MHz
-e			Enable checking firmware version with default verification file 
			"/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-v ver_file		Enable checking firmware version with ver_file file, 
			instead of default: "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-s			Take a snapshot of state


Examples:

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file, verifies fw_version with
  "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version" and prints logs to stdout

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -e

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file, verifies fw_version with
  ver_file file and prints logs to stdout

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -v ver_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to stdout

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to
  out_file file

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -o out_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to stdout

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -t

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to 
  out_file file

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -t -o out_file

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to stdout

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -p

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to out_file file

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -p -o out_file

- Get traces from trace_dump file and prints logs to stdout

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump

- Get traces from trace_dump file and prints logs to out_file file

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file

- c flag is intented for defining clock value (in MHz) used to format log 
  timestamps. By default clock value is set to 19.2 (MHz). Below example
  set clock value to 19.9 (MHz).

  $ sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file -c 19.9


sof-coredump-reader
===================

Tool for processing FW stack dumps. In verbose mode it prints the stack leading
to the core dump including DSP registers and function calls.
It outputs unwrapped gdb command function call addresses to human readable
function call format either to a file or stdout.

Usage sof-coredump-reader.py [-h] [-a ARCH] [-c] [-l COLUMNCOUNT] [-v]
				(--stdout | -o OUTFILE) [--stdin | -i INFILE]

-h			show this help message and exit
-a ARCH			determine architecture of dump file; valid archs are: LE64bit, LE32bit
-c			set output to be colourful
-l COLUMNCOUNT		set how many colums to group the output in
-v			increase output verbosity
--stdin			input is from stdin
-i INFILE		path to sys dump bin
--stdout		output is to stdout
-o OUTFILE		output is to FILE

sof-coredump-to-gdb.sh shows example usage of sof-coredump-reader.py
We read from dump file into sof-coredump-reader.py,
then we pipe its output to xt-gdb, which operates on given elf-file.

  $ ./sof-coredump-to-gdb.sh sof-apl dump_file
