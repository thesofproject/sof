# A generic AIF_IN/AIF_OUT widget. All attributes defined herein are namespaced
# by alsatplg to "Object.host.direction.attribute_name" in the parent object
#
# Usage: host widget can be instantiated by declaring in a parent object as:
#
# For playback:
# 	Object.Widget.host."playback" {
#		index			3
#		type		 	aif_in
#	}
#
# For Capture:
# 	Object.Widget.host."capture" {
#		index			4
#		type			aif_out
#	}

#
# "host" class belongs to the "Widget" group of classes.
#
