# Host gateway capture pipeline
#
# A host gateway pipeline for capture with TDFB and DRC processing. All attributes
# defined herein are namespaced by alsatplg to
# "Object.Pipeline.host-gateway-tdfb-drc-capture.N.attribute_name".
#
# Usage: host-gateway-tdfb-drc-capture pipeline object can be instantiated as:
#
# Object.Pipeline.host-gateway-tdfb-drc-capture."N" {
# 	period		1000
# 	time_domain	"timer"
# }
#
# Where N is the unique pipeline ID within the same alsaconf node.
