# SOF Corpus Directory

====================

The following directory is a special directory containing binary transcripts of
IPC messages from various devices. When OSS-Fuzz runs, it zips these files up
into a output directory to be used as seed material for the fuzzers.

Feel free to add more examples to this directory, more components and state
coverage the better.

## How to generate these files

These files are generated by live dumping the IPC messages, the initial batch
were created by adding a hook to write binary ipc window to the /tmp directory
from the kernel every time a IPC TX occurred. These files were then
concatenated together in order sent. A single file represents a single DSP
lifecycle. If you inspect the data, you will be able to parse out each IPC at
SOF_IPC_MSG_MAX_SIZE byte intervals.
