  # When upgrading projects here please run git log --oneline in the
  # project and if not too long then include the output in your commit
  # message. See examples of good commit messages at
  # https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/commits/4e1d3ba61abd3/rimage
  # (git log 4e1d3ba61abd3 -- rimage/)

  # WARNING: for backwards compatibility with non-Zephyr platforms,
  # rimage and toml99 are STILL git submodules! Every time you change
  # their `revision` revision here you MUST keep their git submodules in
  # sync. This is as simple as `git add rimage` before committing (+
  # `git commit --amend` if you forgot and already committed this
  # west manifest file).

  # When a submodule is out of sync then both `git status` and `git
  # describe` notice and a "-dirty" suffix appears in the SOF version.
  # It is generally very bad practice to git push without looking
  # at "git status"; even without submodules.

    # West convenience for Zephyr people who forgot --recursive when
    # cloning sof.git.  This adds the burden of keeping both tomlc99
    # SHA1s synchronized but in practice it barely ever moves.
