# Logging options

# Set default runtime log level to INFO (3).
# Note: This setting only has effect when CONFIG_LOG_RUNTIME_FILTERING is enabled.
# By default, the runtime level equals the compile-time level, but it is explicitly
# set here to INFO to ensure expected behavior if platform configurations set a
# lower default level (e.g., ERROR).
