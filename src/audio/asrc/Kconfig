	  Select for Asynchronous sample rate conversion (ASRC)
	  component. The ASRC has the capabilities of (synchronous)
	  SRC but can in addition track a slave DAI that is not in
	  sync with firmware timer. The ASRC can be setup for
	  synchronous operation without DAI tracking via topology
	  though it has a bit higher computational load than SRC. The
	  RAM footprint of ASRC is smaller than SRC because it does
	  not have pre-computed filter coefficients for every
	  conversion fraction that SRC does.

	  This option enables all supported downsampling conversions
	  for the asynchronous sample rate conversion. All the
	  upsampling conversions use the same filter always enabled
	  coefficients set so there is no configuration options for
	  them. The enabled conversions consume about 18 kB of memory.

config COMP_ASRC_DOWNSAMPLING_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom downsampling conversions support"
	help
	  This option used to manually select each downsampling ratio.
	  In order to optimize the text code size of the sample rate
	  converter, non-required conversion ratios can be
	  deactivated.  Disregarding these settings, the sample rate
	  converter always supports all conversion ratios with fs_in
	  less or equal to fs_out. Therefore, it is possible to
	  deactivate all conversion ratios listed below, if we only
	  need an (asynchronous) 1:1 sample rate conversion, e.g, from
	  16 kHz to 16 kHz. This option allows to trim down the coefficient
	  memory for conversion down from default 18 kB. Each conversion
	  needs about 2 kB.
