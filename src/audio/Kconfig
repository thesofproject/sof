	  may have to other modules.

	default y
	help
	 Select to support sending large data blobs to firmware as
	 multiple IPC messages. Not all components or modules need
	 this. If unsure, say yes.

	int "Maximum IPC blob size in bytes"
	default 8192
	help
	  Specify the maximum size of IPC4 module blob data that can be

	bool "Build all selected third-party (3P) components with stubs"
	help
	  Select to force all 3P blocks to link against stubs rather than their libraries. This
	  should only be used in testing environments like fuzzers or CI.

config COMP_TONE
	bool "Tone component"
	select CORDIC_FIXED
	help
	  Select for Tone component.
	  Warning: This component is deprecated and will be removed from SOF v2.8.

	   Select this to force the kpb draining copy type to normal.
	   Unselecting this will keep the kpb sink copy type unchanged.

config COMP_MODULE_ADAPTER
	bool "Module adapter"
	default y
	help
	  This component is an adapter between SoF components and any external third
	  party codecs/libraries. In order to make use of it the library itself should
	  be statically linked with the SoF FW binary image and the codec details, such as its
	  ID or specific methods provided in generic interface object located under
	  "src\include\sof\audio\module_adapter\interfaces.h". It is possible to link several
	  different codecs and use them in parallel.
