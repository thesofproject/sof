config SOF_TELEMETRY
	bool "enable telemetry"
	default n
	help
	  Enables telemetry. Enables performance measurements and debug utilities
	  that use memory window 2 (debug window) as interface. Measurements include
	  systick_info measurement which measures scheduler task performance and may
	  slightly affect overall performance.

config SOF_TELEMETRY_PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENTS
	bool "enable performance measurements"
	default n
	help
	  Enables performance measurements. Requires ADSP_MW interface. Each created component
	  can have its performance checked by measuring execution time of copy function.
	  Performance records are stored in the limited number of slots in Memory Window 3,
	  so only a certain number (PERFORMANCE_DATA_ENTRIES_COUNT) of components can be measured.

config SOF_TELEMETRY_IO_PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENTS
	bool "enable I/O performance measurements"
	help
	  Enables IO performance measurements. Each data interface will have its data throughput
	  measured (IPC/IDC and GPIO will measure number of messages/state changes).
	  Disabled by default and enabled with IPC. Measurements can be extracted also by IPC.
	  Interfaces measured: IPC, IDC, DMIC, I2S, SNDW, HDA, USB, GPIO, I2c, I3C, UART, SPI, CSI_2, DTF.
