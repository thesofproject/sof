	  Debug stream is an abstract stream of records of debug
	  information from SOF system that are streamed from SOF DSP
	  to the host side for decoding and presentation. This option
	  enables transferring the records from DSP to host over a

	  Which debug slot to reserve for Debug Stream. Remember to map
	  the slot with MEMORY_WIN_2_SIZE in soc/intel/intel_adsp/Kconfig,
	  in Zephyr source tree. The slots are 4k in size and one slot is
	  used for descriptors, so for slot 3 to be mapped, the WIN_2_SIZE
	  must be (1 + 3) * 4k = 16k or greater.
