# This is a "brute force" solution to filesystem permission issues:
#
# If the current user does not own the current directory then this
# wrapper script switches to the user who does own the current directory
# before running the given command.

# If no user owns the current directory, a user who does gets created
# first!

# The main use case is to run this first thing inside a container to
# solve file ownership mismatches.

# `docker run --user=$(id -un) ...` achieves something very similar
# without any code except the resulting user many not exist inside the
# container. Some commands may not like that.
#
# To understand more about the Docker problem solved here take a look at
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35291520/docker-and-userns-remap-how-to-manage-volume-permissions-to-share-data-betwee
# and many other similar questions.
