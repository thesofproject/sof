	help
	  Available memory banks count for High Performance memory
	  Lowering available banks could result in lower power consumption
	  Too low count should result in unresponsive/crashing image due to not
	  enough space for FW base image
	  Banks are 64kb in size.

	  Turn ON/OFF LPSRAM bank/s. This provides an option to enable an LPSRAM
	  memory for specific platform. Until this options is enabled firmware will
	  not enable any of LPSRAM memory banks.

	  Hardware linked list is the DW-DMA feature, which allows
	  to automatically reload the next programmed linked list
	  item from memory without stopping the transfer. Without
	  it the transfer stops after every lli read and FW needs
	  to manually setup the next transfer.

	  Any platforms with hardware linked list support
	  should set this.

config DW_DMA_AGGREGATED_IRQ
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Some platforms cannot register interrupt per DW-DMA channel
	  and have the possibility only to register interrupts per
	  DMA controller, which require manual handling of aggregated
	  irq.

	  Any platforms with DW-DMA aggregated interrupts support
	  should set this.

config DMA_SUSPEND_DRAIN
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Some platforms cannot just simple disable DMA
	  channel during the transfer, because it will
	  hang the whole DMA controller. Instead we can
	  suspend the channel and drain the FIFO in order
	  to stop the channel as soon as possible.

	  Any platforms without the ability to disable
	  the DMA channel right away should set this.

config DMA_FIFO_PARTITION
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Some platforms require to manually set DMA
	  FIFO partitions before starting any transfer.

	  Any platforms without automatic FIFO partitions
	  should set this.

config INTERRUPT_LEVEL_1

	  Disabling this option allows for less memory consumption.

	bool "Blocks freeing debug"
	default n
	help
	  It enables checking if free was called multiple times on
	  already freed block of memory. Enabling this feature increases
	  number of memory writes and reads, due to checks for memory patterns
	  that may be performed on allocation and deallocation.

config DEBUG_LOCKS
