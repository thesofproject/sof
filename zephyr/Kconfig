	  SOF staging features are not ready for production but are
	  upstream to enable developers to continue development in order
	  to bring the feature to production level faster using the
	  upstream codebase.

config SOF_ZEPHYR_HEAP_CACHED
	bool "Cached Zephyr heap for SOF memory non-shared zones"
	default y if CAVS || ACE
	default n
	help
	  Enable cached heap by mapping cached SOF memory zones to different
	  Zephyr sys_heap objects and enable caching for non-shared zones.

	help
	 Support scaling of the heap size for different platforms and different types
	 of heaps. This is the default heap size for most users.
	 TODO: Currently this setting is only available on platforms with a
	 simplified heap size configuration. i.e. a single macro that defines the
	 heap size. This is not the case for all platforms.
	 NOTE: Keep in mind that the heap size should not be greater than the physical
	 memory size of the system defined in DT (and this includes baseFW text/data).

	 Support scaling of the virtual address heap size for different platforms.

	 memory size of the system defined in DT (and this includes baseFW text/data).

	  This enables the usage of the DMA domain in scheduling.

	  Set this value according to the load of the system. Please make sure

	  executing at some point (worst case).

config PIPELINE_2_0
	bool "Enable pipeline 2.0 changes"
	depends on IPC_MAJOR_4
	default y if ACE

	  This flag enables changes to new pipeline structure, known as pipeline2_0

	  Enable Data Processing preemptive scheduler based on

	  DP modules can be located in dieffrent cores than LL pipeline modules, may have
	  different tick (i.e. 300ms for speech reccognition, etc.)

config CROSS_CORE_STREAM
	bool "Enable cross-core connected pipelines"
	default y if IPC_MAJOR_4
	help
	  Enables support for pipelines from different cores to be
	  connected together cross-core. So stream can travel from one
	  core to another. Note, this is different from "multicore"
	  support. In SOF "multicore" support means different streams
	  can be processed on different cores, however, each stream
	  is processed entirely on single core.

config SOF_BOOT_TEST

	depends on ZTEST
	help
	  Run tests during boot. This enables an SOF boot-time self-test. When
	  enabled, the resulting image will run a number of self-tests when the
	  first global IPC command is received, i.e. when SOF is completely
	  initialized. After that SOF will continue running and be usable as
	  usual.

config SOF_ZEPHYR_NO_SOF_CLOCK
	bool
	help
	  Do not use SOF clk.h interface to set the DSP clock frequency.
	  Requires implementation of platform/lib/clk.h.

config VIRTUAL_HEAP

	default n
	depends on ACE
	help
	  Enabling this option will use the virtual memory heap allocator to allocate buffers.
	  It is based on a set of buffers whose size is predetermined.
