# Do not mass copy/paste/diverge in every project your non-project
# specific, personal git ignore preferences like: *.mbox, *.patch, *.rej,
# cscope*, TAGS, *~,...
#
# Instead, set your non-project specific, personal git ignore preference
# only once for all git projects in your home directory:
#     https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
# So this does not interfere other people's "git status" preferences.
#
# Also, don't use `git add *` or `git commit -a` and git push blindly
# without a look at which files are getting pushed. This is bad no
# matter what is in git ignore.
