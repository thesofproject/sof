# Tools that can save round-trips to github and a lot of time:
#
# yamllint -f parsable pull_request.yml
# pip3 install ruamel.yaml.cmd
# yaml merge-expand pull_request.yml exp.yml &&
#    diff -w -u pull_request.yml exp.yml
#
# github.com also has a powerful web editor that can be used without
# committing.
